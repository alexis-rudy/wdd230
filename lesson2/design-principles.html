            <p>>On this page you can see the use of contrast in the words. Apple wants you to focus on two
                things in their product: the H2 chip, and the computational algorithms. To make you focus on those
                two features, they're put in different colors that grab your eye's attention and let the rest of 
                the text fade into the background.

            <p> >Gamestop uses Hick's Law by showing only the most popular brands that people buy on their site. There are
                tons of companies that make games, devices, merchandise and so on that are found on the page. However, if the
                developers had chosen to put them all on the page in one spot, not only would the user get overwhelmed by the choices,
                but they might find an easier site to get what they were looking for. By only showing 10 options on the home
                page, Gamestop has eliminated that possibility.

            <p>>Fitt's Law is shown in the big call to action and input box on the home page of Netflix's site.
                There is less time for the user to make across the screen as it takes up a good chunk of the area
                it's in. Also, because of the size of the input box and the button, it's hard for the user to miss 
                and accidentally click somewhere else on the page.
