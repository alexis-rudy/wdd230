            <h3>Persona 1 - Recently Relocated</h3>
            <p class="personaText">
                Boise and it's surrounding areas are growing rapidly. Nampa is one
                of those cities that seems to always have new residents relocating.
                New members of the city will need a site that they can easily access
                for information on business, events, and weather. Most new residents
                of Nampa are parents of families. The site will need to accommodate 
                someone who is trying to quickly find family friendly activities to 
                attend, local sports teams to get their children into, as well as 
                events for just the parents to escape to. This persona will access
                the site through either a desktop computer, or a mobile device.
            </p>
            <h3>Persona 2 - Business Owner</h3>
            <p class="personaText">
                As a business owner in Nampa, keeping up with other businesses is a
                priority. An old owner would need to know about new businesses opening 
                in the city, any renovations happening, promotions other businesses
                are running, and which places are shutting down. Additionally, the
                business owner would need to know of events in the city and whether
                or not they allow promotion. If the owner is opening a new business,
                they would need the same information above, as well as information on
                local business to work with. This persona will access the site through
                either a desktop computer or a mobile device.
